# Dabao App

## Technologies Used

HTML, CSS, React, Mongoose, Express, mongo.db, JavaScript & Material-UI

## Approach towards project

The idea is simple, work's pilling up, you're hungry but can't go out even for 5 minutes, thats where Dabao comes in clutch for you. 
Want to go out and do a favour for a stranger? Dabao is here to help you. 

For Dabao, we prioritised functionality & simplicity over more excessive & bloated features, we tried to ensure that everything in the app had a reason to be there.
Everything had to be light weight and streamlined and that was what we aimed for when we started working on it.

We started with a wireframe to assist in visualising how we wanted Dabao to look like instead of diving right into the code.
We also took some time to think through about the schema and data flow. These really helped us because there were times where we hit the wall, we could always go back to these resources that we prepared beforehand. 

For this project, we praticed our fullstack skills, no one in the team was designated a specific end of the stack, everyone had a part in both front and back ends. When we faced problems, we tackled them as a team. There were times where there were objectives that we wanted to meet but couldn't be able to but all in all, we are quite happy with our App, Dabao,

## User Stories

Our App consist of two types of users, Dabao-er and Dabao-ee, for the DB-er, the purpose is simple, Db-er A is going to XXX to buy food and there are times when I wish someone bought food back for me, so why not be altruistic? 

First, I'll sign in on the app and then I want to help Dabao either from clicking on the Nav Bar or clicking on the "Going out to Dabao?" panel.

Then I'll fill up a short questionnaire where I'll state where I'm going to buy food from and where I'll be dropping off the requested orders at.

Following that will be the dashboard where I'll be able to view orders and communicate with all the DB-ees. If I'm unable to fulfill the request, I can also delete it. 

While for the DB-ee, work is never ends since I'm always working from home, so let's see whos around me to help me Dabao some food?
So as a DB-ee, I'll sign in the app and then request for help or clicking on the "Too busy to head out?" panel.

I'll be greeted by a board filled with DB-ers offers in my area. If I see an entry that suits my needs, I will click the "+" button which will allow me to communciate with the DB-er through the dashboard.

Finally, I will then proceed to the dashboard where I'll be able to view the job as well as communicate with the DB-er for my needs.

## Unsolved Problems/Major Hurdles

- A better UI for the pages
- No Realtime chat
- Mongoose
- Having to pivot from using specific stall data to just using a general hawker centre data
- Data visualisations, instead of a table, a map couldve been used instead
- A more concise match schema, instead of using postal codes, we could've used food preferences etc.
